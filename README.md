# Online Resume

Online cv created based on this template: [gatsby-starter-cv](https://github.com/ajimenezdev/gatsby-cv).
I change this for my purposes.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    npx gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/thibaud-ritzenthaler/gatsby-cv
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    yarn develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    \_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1. **Generate production build**

That command will generate a production build on _public_ folder
  ```sh
    yarn build
  ```

## Configuration

Update the configuration file with your data. The configuration file is in ```data/siteConfig.js```
